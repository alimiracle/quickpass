# Quickly generate strong random passwords #

With **quickpass**, you can quickly and easily generate strong passwords from the comfort of your terminal using nothing more than just a few common Unix command line utilities and device blocks. Here's how to use it:

To generate a single, 32-character random password, just type:

    ./quickpass

To generate a random password specifically with 42 characters in length, type:

    ./quickpass -l 42

To generate a list of fifteen random passwords, type:

    ./quickpass -n 15

You can use these two options in any combination to suit your needs.

# Technical explanation and a note about security #

`quickpass` is a very simple implementation of translating a sampling of random bytes from the `/dev/urandom` device with `base64` into something that is human-readable and therefore applicable to be used as a password.

The reliability of this script lays mostly on the quality of the randomness obtained from the `urandom` file: it should be noted that, despite its name, it's actually a *pseudorandom* generator (although it samples hardware noise to compensate). 

This means that from a strict security standpoint, this is **not** a true random generator, although it's pretty good regardless. OpenSSL certs and PGP keys are also generated using those bits, so I guess it should be pretty reliable.

## Entropy analysis and password strength ##

This [excellent article](https://pthree.org/2014/03/16/creating-strong-passwords-without-a-computer-part-0-understanding-entropy/) by Aaron Toponce gives a good basis from which password strength can be measured: information **entropy**. Entropy for a password can be calculated like this:

    H = L * log(N)/log(2)

Where `L` is the length in characters and `N` is the number of possibilities that a single character can be in the password. `quickpass` generates passwords with the following possible characters:

 - 26 lowercase ASCII letters
 - 26 uppercase ASCII letters
 - 10 digits
 - 2 non-alphanumeric characters (`/` and `+`)

This gives us a per-character entropy of 6 bits, but how much do we need?

Aaron gives us the answer again: any password with less than 72 bits of entropy can be brute-forced by the Bitcoin Blockchain in **less than a minute**, making his recommendation of 80 or more bits. The standard 32-character password generated by `quickpass` has an entropy of 192 bits, so you should be pretty safe.

Remember, however, that for some weird reason a few online services put a cap on how long a password can be, forcing you to use less secure passwords. Although you can easily change that using the `-l` option, remember to stay above the 80 bit threshold, which for `quickpass` would be 14 characters.  Anything less, and you're as vulnerable as picking passwords like `monkey`.
